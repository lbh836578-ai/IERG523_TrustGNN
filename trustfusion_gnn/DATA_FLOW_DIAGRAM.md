# TrustFusion-GNN Data Flow Diagram

This file documents the current end-to-end data path between ESP32 nodes, the Raspberry Pi gateway, and the TrustFusion-GNN cloud side.

## Frequency Summary

| Segment | Current frequency | Source |
|---|---:|---|
| ESP32 -> MQTT Broker | Unknown in this repo | Depends on ESP32 firmware; not defined in the Raspberry Pi or cloud repositories |
| MQTT Broker -> Raspberry Pi | Same as ESP32 publish rate | Event-driven subscription |
| Raspberry Pi parsing | Immediate, once per message | MQTT callback path |
| Raspberry Pi processing | Immediate, once per message | Data processor callback |
| Edge anomaly detection | Immediate, once per valid reading | Uses 20-point historical window |
| Local SQLite storage | Immediate, once per valid processed message | Written during callback flow |
| Cloud upload queue append | Immediate, once per valid processed message | Appended during callback flow |
| Raspberry Pi -> Cloud batch upload | Every 30 seconds | Configured `upload_interval` |
| Cloud upload batch size | Up to 50 records per batch | Configured uploader batch size |
| Cloud model sampling assumption | 1 Hz | TrustFusion-GNN config |
| Cloud model window size | 60 points | TrustFusion-GNN config |
| Cloud evaluation interval | Every 5 seconds | TrustFusion-GNN config |
| Simulated dataset generation | Manual / on-demand | Script-triggered |
| Model training on simulated data | Manual / on-demand | Script-triggered |
| Data-quality analysis | Manual / on-demand | Script-triggered |

## Practical Interpretation

If your ESP32 publishes at 1 Hz, then the timing becomes:

1. Raspberry Pi receives one new message every second.
2. The 20-point edge buffer represents about 20 seconds of recent history.
3. The TrustFusion-GNN 60-point model window represents about 60 seconds of history.
4. The cloud uploader sends one HTTP batch approximately every 30 seconds.

If the ESP32 publish rate is not 1 Hz, then the Pi side still works, but the cloud-side GNN timing assumptions no longer match exactly and a resampling or alignment layer is needed.
